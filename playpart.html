            _[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
        extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
        entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the
        doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
        and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
        and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
        door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
        chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
        table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
        objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
        carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._
        <br>
        <br>
        _A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
        open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
        dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
        the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
        seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
        gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_
        <br>
        <br>
        NORA.
        <br>
        Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
        see it until this evening, when it is dressed. _[To the PORTER, taking
        out her purse.]_ How much?
        <br>
        <br>
        PORTER.
        <br>
        Sixpence.
        <br>
        <br>
        NORA.
        <br>
        There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _[The PORTER thanks her, and
        goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
        off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
        and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
        listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
        right.]_
        <br>
        <br>
        HELMER.
        <br>
        _[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
        there?
        <br>
        <br>
        NORA.
        <br>
        _[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!
        <br>
        <br>
        HELMER.
        <br>
        Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
        <br>
        <br>
        NORA.
        <br>
        Yes!
        <br>
        <br>
        HELMER.
        <br>
        When did my squirrel come home?
        <br>
        <br>
        NORA.
        <br>
        Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
        mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
