            _[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
            extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
            entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the
            doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
            and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
            and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
            door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
            chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
            table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
            objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
            carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._

            _A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
            open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
            dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
            the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
            seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
            gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_

        <h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
            see it until this evening, when it is dressed.

            _[To the PORTER, taking out her purse.]_
        </p>
        <p>
            How much?
        </p>
        <h5 class="porter">PORTER.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Sixpence.

        <h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            There is a shilling. No, keep the change.
        </p>
        <p class="direction">
            _[The PORTER thanks her, and
            goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
            off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
            and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
            listens.]_
        </p> 
        <p class="speech">
            Yes, he is in.

            Is that my little lark twittering out there?

            _[busy opening some of the parcels]_.

            Yes, it is!

            Is it my little squirrel bustling about?

            Yes!

        <p class="speech"> 
            When did my squirrel come home?

            Just now.

            Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
